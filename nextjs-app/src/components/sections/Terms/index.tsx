                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Estimated Turnaround Time</h2>
                    <p>We will provide an estimated turnaround time. The estimate is based on the current workload and volume of work currently being handled. Current situations are all we can honestly gauge a projected timeline on. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you understand that this turnaround estimated time can change dramatically due to the circumstances listed below, as well as other factors.</p>
                    <p>Agreement is NON Binding.</p>

                    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Updates</h2>
                    <p>I will provide periodic updates on your project. These will usually be when I have performed some actual work but will also try and update as to general status, particularly if turnaround times are changing (for better or worse). Feel free to email in an inquiry if you have not heard from us in a while, such as in excess of 4 weeks. We do not consider asking for an update to be “bugging me”. I prefer email due to the record I can refer to later and the fact that it can be handled when I have time during the day. The phone is not as reliable since I may not answer it while working. All work will be processed in order. Small work (non-build+refinish) work WILL be started ahead of existing larger jobs and turns around at a much faster rate than the larger projects.</p>
