            <h2>Cerakote Gun Coatings Hardness Test: ASTM D3363</h2>

            <p><strong>Cerakote Hardness:</strong> Hardness, or Pencil Hardness (ASTM D3363), is measured by using different grades of pencil lead to cut through the coating surface. To conduct this test, a coated panel is placed on a flat, horizontal surface. A weighted trolley with the hardest pencil lead (9H) is placed on the panel and pushed away from the operator. The length of the stroke should be about 6.5mm.</p>

            <p>This process is repeated until a lead is found that will not cut through the coating to the metal for a distance of at least 3mm (this is the pencil hardness rating). This process is then repeated until a lead is found that will not scratch the coating (this is the scratch hardness rating). Cerakote H-146 Graphite Black finished strong with a 9H hardness rating, the highest hardness rating that can be achieved.</p>
