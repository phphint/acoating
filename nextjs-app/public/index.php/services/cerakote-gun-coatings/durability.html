            <h2>Cerakote Gun Coatings Durability ASTM: D2794</h2>
            
            <p>Cerakote durability impact resistance (ASTM D2794) measures the resistance of organic coatings to the effects of rapid deformation (impact). Impact resistance is measured by placing a coated panel in a universal impact tester. A standard weight is dropped from a distance to strike an indenter that deforms the coating and the substrate. The indentation can be either an intrusion or an extrusion.</p>
            <p>By gradually increasing the distance from which the weight is dropped (1 inch at a time), the point of failure can be determined by observing cracking or delamination of the coating. Cerakote H-146 Graphite Black was tested to have an impact strength measuring 160 inch-lbs, which is the maximum the impact tester can measure.</p>
