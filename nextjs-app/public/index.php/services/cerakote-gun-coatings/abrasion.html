    <h2>Cerakote Gun Coatings Abrasion Test vs Other Finishes</h2>
    <p>TEST: ASTM D4060</p>
    <p><strong class="highlight">Cerakote Abrasion:</strong> Taber Abrasion is a test using a weighted abrasive wheel that rotates at a constant speed to determine the resistance of finishes to abrasion and wear, according to ASTM D4060.</p>
    <p>Cerakote™ H-146 Graphite Black was compared against 7 competitive finishes, each tested three times to validate results. The test used a 1000 gram weight on CS-17 Taber Abrasion wheels, with panels cycled until breakthrough. Panels exceeding 500 cycles had their wheels cleaned every 500 cycles as required for accurate results.</p>
    <p>Final wear ratings were calculated by measuring the weight loss of the test panel, multiplied by 1,000, then divided by the number of cycles completed before wear-through. Based on ASTM D4060, Cerakote™ finished strong, outlasting the nearest competitor by nearly twice as long and 24 times as long as the least effective finish.</p>
